# Repository Name: Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations and practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python, as well as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It includes beginner-level to advanced-level algorithms, providing a thorough understanding of both linear and non-linear data structures, and the application of OOP in solving algorithmic problems.

## What is DSA?

**Data Structures** are ways of organizing and storing data to perform operations efficiently. **Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Together, DSA forms the core of problem-solving skills in computer science and is essential for coding interviews, competitive programming, and system design.

### Types of Data Structures:
- **Linear Data Structures**: Data structures where elements are arranged in a linear order.
  - Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- **Non-Linear Data Structures**: Data structures where elements are not in a sequential order.
  - Examples: Trees, Graphs, Heaps

### Types of Algorithms:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Algorithms to sort a collection of data.
  - Examples: QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort
- **Search Algorithms**: Techniques to search for a specific element in a collection.
  - Examples: Binary Search, Linear Search
- **Graph Algorithms**: Algorithms that involve graph traversal and finding paths.
  - Examples: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking problems into simpler subproblems.
  - Examples: Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem

## File Descriptions

- **advanced_python**: Contains advanced Python concepts such as decorators, generators, context managers, and more. These topics help in writing efficient and clean Python code.
  
- **MNC_ask_question**: Implements data structures and algorithms specifically focused on Google's approach, including questions from their coding interviews and algorithmic challenges.
  
- **linear_dsa**: Implements linear data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. These are the foundation of most algorithmic problems and are essential for understanding more complex structures.

- **logical_dsa**: Focuses on logical problems and challenges related to data structures and algorithms. This includes pattern recognition, mathematical puzzles, and optimization problems.

- **normal**: Contains basic data structures and algorithm implementations. This file is suitable for beginners starting with DSA and looking to solidify their understanding.

- **oops**: Explains **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and demonstrates how they can be applied to solve algorithmic problems. Key OOP concepts covered:
  - **Classes and Objects**: Encapsulation of data and behavior into objects.
  - **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones.
  - **Polymorphism**: Using a single interface to represent different underlying forms.
  - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.
  - **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.

- **non_linear_dsa**: Implements non-linear data structures like trees, graphs, and heaps. These structures allow for more complex operations like hierarchical storage and graph traversal.
